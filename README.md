### Project Description
This project is an innovative online compiler that compiles code using the Google Gemini API. It provides real-time feedback by displaying Malayalam movie stickers reflecting the severity of errors, and includes a unique interactive ‚Äúfix now‚Äù feature that challenges users with an impossible game before revealing error solutions.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most compilers give boring, plain error messages that make debugging dull and frustrating. But what if errors could be fun and motivating instead? Our project solves this ‚Äúnon-problem‚Äù by turning error feedback into an engaging experience using Malayalam movie stickers and a quirky game ‚Äî making coding enjoyable even when things go wrong!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Why settle for dull error messages when you can get your code reviewed by Malayalam movie stickers? We compile your code with Google Gemini API and respond with the perfect sticker mood for every error level ‚Äî from chill vibes for minor glitches to drama-worthy reactions for big mistakes. And if you want to fix it? Beat our impossible dot-clicking game first! Debugging just got way more entertaining.
